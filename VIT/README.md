# VisionTransformer-From-Scratch

This repository contains PyTorch code which implements Vision Transformer (VIT). (https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)
It is only meant for educational purposes, to understand how the VIT works and get a feeling for the implementation.
It is not meant to be used for actually training VIT. More robust and optimized implementations can be found on https://github.com/lucidrains/vit-pytorch.
